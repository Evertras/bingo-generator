# Bingo Generator

Generates Bingo cards in the browser.

Partly an excuse to try [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

## Requirements

The Bingo Generator must do the following:

* Board size must be variable but square (NxN)
* Pictures must be uploadable, but do NOT need to be saved in remote storage
* Must print 2 to a page in PDF to optimize for A5 paper use

Stretch goal:

* Upload a premade bingo card and automatically generate permutations
